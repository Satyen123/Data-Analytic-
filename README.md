*  **Conclusions & Insights**

---

### Technologies Used

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
* Jupyter Notebook
* Data preprocessing, visualization, clustering

---

###  Sample Visuals

* Top 10 countries by population
* Growth trends for India, China, USA, Nigeria
* Clusters of countries based on area, growth, and density
* Heatmap of correlations between key indicators

---

### Key Insights

* Asia remains the most populated continent, with China and India leading globally.
* African nations are showing the fastest population growth rates.
* Countries with small areas often exhibit high population densities.
* Clustering helped group countries with similar population dynamics.
